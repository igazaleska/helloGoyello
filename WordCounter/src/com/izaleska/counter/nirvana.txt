Come
As you are
As you were
As I want you to be
As a friend
As a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time
Hurry up
The choice is yours
don`t be late
Take a rest 
As a friend 
As an old memoria
Memoria 
Memoria
Memoria
Come
Dowsed in mud
Soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend
As a friend
As an old memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
Memoria
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun 
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
Memoria
Memoria
